        Throughout my career, I have honed my expertise in utilizing modern web
        technologies, particularly the MERN stack, to create visually stunning
        and user-friendly web applications. My experience spans various domains,
        including building dynamic and responsive interfaces for building
        automation systems and floor heating systems using AngularJS, as well as
        developing robust and scalable web interfaces for centralized, web-based
        services using ReactJS with TypeScript. Furthermore, I am currently
        expanding my skill set by learning Azure cloud technologies, including
        Azure App Service, Azure Database, Azure Storage, and more. This
        initiative reflects my commitment to staying abreast of emerging
        technologies and leveraging them to drive innovation and deliver
        cutting-edge solutions.
