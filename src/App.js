          <h3>PROFILE</h3>
          <article>
            Throughout my career, I have honed my expertise in utilizing modern web technologies, particularly the MERN stack, to create visually stunning and user-friendly web applications. My experience spans various domains, including building dynamic and responsive interfaces for building automation systems and floor heating systems using AngularJS, as well as developing robust and scalable web interfaces for centralized, web-based services using ReactJS with TypeScript. Furthermore, I am currently expanding my skill set by learning Azure cloud technologies, including Azure App Service, Azure Database, Azure Storage, and more. This initiative reflects my commitment to staying abreast of emerging technologies and leveraging them to drive innovation and deliver cutting-edge solutions.

            <h2>Analysing | Exploring</h2>
            <article>
              I prefer following established and proven approaches when dealing with any obstacles. I appreciate the need for authority and rules and can adjust easily to this. I am generally practical and down to earth but at times may benefit from keeping an open mind to new or novel approaches to problems.
              I prefer to take decisions based on feelings or instinct rather than rely on evidence. As a result, I tend to pay attention to different views and opinions rather than spending the time analysing data.

            <article>
              I display empathy towards colleagues and find it important to listen to their points of view. I am likely to involve others in key decisions and plans. I give credit where it is due and delegate easily when necessary.
              I am someone who feels at ease when connecting with new people and generally has a well-developed network.

            <article>
              I prefer to work in stable environments and am uncomfortable with dealing with unplanned changes.
              I am a good team player who pays attention to everyone's input in a group setting. I generally prefer to work in an individual capacity rather than lead teams.
              I may feel demotivated when faced with negative feedback or setbacks.
